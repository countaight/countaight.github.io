<!--
* How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
* Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
* What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
* What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

It was so awesome collaborating with someone on wireframing and creating the HTML. It was just great to bounce off ideas and learning so much from other simultaneously. Learning the semantic tags of HTML was definitely more enjoyable and easier too, by having someone verify the information or explain it further.

I found wireframing to be very helpful, it definitely help set the overall layout of the page and really broke it down into small pieces that were easy to keep track of. By sectioning off the various parts using tags such as aside for side bars, or article for major posts, such as blog posts, it brings awareness to how your site will communicate with the computer, browsers, and other users.

Our pair and I decided that a good wireframe was simple and organized. the less cluttered boxes the better. Also, the more specific the semantic tag the better. for example, an unordered list within a <nav> tag is obviously a navigational bar. It's specific tags like these that really create the foundation of a page.

The tag article was new to us, and it's perfect for things like blog posts or news articles. That really helped simplify the layout.
