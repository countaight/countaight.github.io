            Greetings! If you have stumbled upon this blog, whether by providence, or the more likely event that I shared the site's link with you, welcome! Take a seat fellow stumbler, technie, non-techie, or mom (you might want to copy and paste this into Google Translate, or va a tener que... you know what, nevermind). Just sit back, relax, and enjoy my stories as a developing developer.
          </p>
          <p>
              Before we begin, I feel the need to lay a foundation of understanding between us. My journey, as many fledgling developers before me, started in the command line. So, while many might be accustomed to colorful graphical interfaces and buttons, and cursors, as a developer we are taught to maneuver among a computer's inner bits (literally), through the use of typed out commands inside a drab black box called a shell or bash. This affords us some benefits, the ability to see clearly the directory (just a fancy way of saying a folder) we're currently in and be able to make changes much quicker and efficiently without having to lift a single finger from the keyboard and touch that germ-covered mouse or trackpad. This visualization is important because as you'll see shortly, certain programs can affect the way we see the bash and the commands we can use. But now I digress...
          </p>
          <p>
              Tiptoeing the thin line that separates geekdom and science is a very popular theory, the multiverse theory. This theory proposes that alongside our very own universe--our very own timeline--exists multiple other universes overlaid and invisible to each other. Each choice made or not made co-exist, infinitely creating more and more universes. Now picture for a second that we could travel between these universes and modify them to our will. We could, theoretically, jump to one universe where we make a small change and when we don't like the change we can simply revert to our original state as if that change was never made. Sounds like science-fiction, but in the programming world this would be an example of a practice and idea known as, version control! Much like the multiverse example, having the ability of version control in projects, is immensely valuable. Again, a developer can start a project and when unsure about how a specific feature would work, they could branch off the original state of the project, experiment and if they are happy with the results, simply merge it back. But, if the results are undesirable, no problem, revert to the original state and delete the branch. Easy peasy, lemon squeezy...

              You saw that? What I just did? I cleverly reeled you into a programming topic by using science! Let's keep moving. Obviously, version control isn't just an abstract idea understood by developers--no, there's actual software out there that facilitates this practice and harnesses the power of multiverse travelling, kinda like Nicholas Cage in that terrible movie. In the software department, we have Git. Remember when I mentioned software that could alter the shell and commands accepted in it? Git is one of those pieces of software. Installing it and initiating it on one of your folders (or directories) deems it the "master" state (and yeah, it's clearly stated on the command line). Afterwards, git-enabled commands (such as git add) help control and track the state of your files easily. Creating "branches" and "commits" all in the name of preserving the original master state until you are happy with the results.
          </p>
          <p>
              Meanwhile, in a remote proverbial cloud or as most of us like to call it, the internet, there resides git's partner-in-crime--GitHub. GitHub is the place to store your newly acquired folders and files currently being tracked by git. But GitHub is not just useful for safely storing your mini-frozen universes that are your files filled with code, in addition, GitHub boasts a robust set of features that are dead set on making it easy for you to share your files with other developers for collaboration or even further sharing. So now, not only are you in possession of multiverse-changing powers, but you can potentially have a team of developers with the same power! What an age to live in!
