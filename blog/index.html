<p>No, I have not messed up my subtitle&hellip; That&rsquo;s a pseudo representation of a regular expression. What&rsquo;s that you ask? Well let me start from the beginning&hellip; I&rsquo;ve discussed before, the slew of built-in methods or functions both, Ruby and JavaScript carry right out of the box. These allow you to create, manipulate, or instruct objects and the program itself to do something for you. After all, isn&rsquo;t that the point of programming? Right down to its source, code is just a series of instructions the computer can read and execute to do work for you. When using these methods/functions, if you recall, you can pass along arguments to further instruct that method/function on how to deal with your objects. Here&rsquo;s a quick example in Ruby:</p>

<pre><code>name = "Oscar"
name.reverse
=&gt; "racsO"
</code></pre>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>&hellip;to be or not to be&hellip;an object&hellip;</h3>

<p><img src="../imgs/javascript-blog/HamletSkullHCSealous.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Up until this point I&rsquo;ve probably repeated the phrase &ldquo;everything is Ruby is an object&rdquo; ad nauseum. But it&rsquo;s for a good reason, it sets a precedent for the definition of everything to come. It is by which we determine our understanding of any interaction with programming objects, just as we would real life objects. For example, if I told you all objects in this world respond to touch, and all brown objects bark, and all small objects can be carried. Then you would know that a small brown object will respond to touch, bark, and can be carried, while you&rsquo;d expect a large brown object to respond to touch, bark, but not necessarily be able to be carried. These characteristics, and these behaviors we know for sure allow us to also modify objects and group them together to share traits. But how do these objects come to be? Surely in our world, creatures are birthed, materials are formed, and certain objects are manufactured. These object creators are just as varied when it comes to object-oriented programming languages. Ruby offers Classes and object instantiation, while JavaScript offers constructor functions.</p>

<h3>Ruby Classes</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already gone into detail as to how Ruby classes work, in this <a href="ruby-classes.html">post</a>. But just to reiterate and to offer a new perspective, here is an example:</p>

<p> ```class Toy
   def initialize(type, name, size, has_fur)
     @type = type
     @name = name
     @size = size
     @has_fur = has_fur
     @color = &ldquo;brown&rdquo;
   end</p>

<p>   def talk
     p &ldquo;I love you&rdquo;
   end</p>

<p>   def is_cuddly?
       if @has_fur
         true
       else
         false
       end
     end
end```</p>

<p>In this class an object can be created by typing:</p>

<p> <code>teddy = Toy.new("Plus", "Teddy", "small", true)</code></p>

<p>The great thing about Ruby classes is that any object created after that gets to use any methods created in that class, and any methods created afterwards. Say whaaaaa? You can create methods after a class has been created. It&rsquo;s this feature that allows pre-existing classes like the Array class to be modified even though they are built-in to Ruby.</p>

<p>The best way to visualize this is like everyone who has a wi-fi enabled teddy bear receiving automatic firmware updates. So in our example, let&rsquo;s say the manufacturers decide to add a new feature to our teddy bear, such as, shouting &ldquo;GET TO THE CHOPPA!&rdquo; Well that would just be a matter of opening up the class again and adding the method.</p>

<pre><code>           ```class Toy
             def shout
               p "GET TO THE CHOPPA!"
             end
           end`
</code></pre>

<p>This immediately grants the shout ability to all existing Toys out there. This allows great flexibility in Ruby because it allows customization of not only classes but pre-existing objects. So if one your objects is not acting the way it should, just add a method to the class. This is quite possibly the biggest difference between Ruby classes and JavaScript constructor functions.</p>

<h3>JavaScript Constructor Functions</h3>

<p>So what is a contructor function? What is JavaScript? Who are you and what have you done with my dog? We all have these questions at one point in our lives. Well to answer the easiest question, JavaScript is another a scripting language predominatly used in web creation. Just like Ruby it is also an object-oriented language, but as you&rsquo;ll see, JavaScript defines objects quite differently.</p>

<p>First of all, JavaScript objects are similar to Ruby hashes, using a variable you can save the state of an object in a key-value form, except in JavaScript they&rsquo;re called properties. These objects have properties that can be anything, a name, a number, even a function (which are similar to Ruby&rsquo;s methods). They take this form:</p>

<pre><code>           ```var teddy = {
             type: "Plush",
             name: "Teddy",
             size: "small",
             color: "brown",
             hasFur: true,
             talk: function() {
               console.log("I love you!");
             },
             isCuddly: function() {
               if(hasFur === true) {
                 return true;
               } else {
                 return false;
               }
             }
           }```
</code></pre>

<p>And to create a new object you&hellip; well you actually have to type all that again. How tedious. Oh, but that&rsquo;s where constructor functions come in. A constructor function is a lot like an assembly line, it allows a template of an object to be created and then it spits out the objects at command. They look a bit like this:<br/>
           `
               <code>function Toy(type, name, size, hasFur) {
                 this.type = type;
                 this.name = name;
                 this.size = size;
                 this.hasFur = hasFur;
                 this.color = "brown";
                 this.talk = function() {
                   console.log("I love you!");
                 };
                 this.isCuddly = function() {
                   if(hasFur === true) {
                     return true;
                   } else {
                     return false;
                   }
                 };
               }</code></p>

<p>And you can spit out a new toy by doing this:</p>

<p><code>var teddy = new Toy("Plush", "Teddy", "small", true)</code></p>

<p>Creating objects this way allows every subsequent toy to be whatever the template told it to be. In web creation this is great to create objects that represent different aspects of your site, such as users, sale items, or even to represent data visually. But going back to how it differs to Ruby&rsquo;s classes, well that&rsquo;s a bit of a quirk. In Javascript changing or adding methods or functions into the constructor function that was used to create the object, is impossible, and changing the properties of the existing objects won&rsquo;t grant other existing objects those abilities. This is like buying a toy that you modify at home, but no one else who has bought the toy, benefits from your alteration.</p>

<p>But if JavaScript objects are not related to constructor functions, then what are they related or linked to? Well that would be prototypes, the subject of which is out of the scope of this blog post. If you would like to learn more however feel free to visit the following resources!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>&hellip;or how the west was won</h3>

<h4>February 28, 2016</h4>

<p>Everything in Ruby is an object. A common mantra among Rubyists, this is meant to remind you that, just like real-world objects, objects in Ruby respond to different methods and are classified by different attributes. Every object, in turn, can also be categorized by their class, which also happens to be an object in the sense that a person can be categorized by race or gender and race and gender itself, although are conceptual, are also things. Apart from the built-in classes offered in Ruby, you are allowed to create new ones to better run your code in groupings of associated attributes and behaviors. Here&rsquo;s how&hellip;</p>

<pre><code>class MinionCard 
  attr_reader :faction, :name, :power 
  def initialize(faction, name, power) 
    @faction = faction 
    @name = name 
    @power = power 
  end 

  def play(base)
    check_other_cards(base)
      @other_cards.each do |card|
        if card.power &lt;= 2
          @other_cards.delete(card)
        end
      end
    base.cards &lt;&lt; self
  end 

  def check_other_cards(base)
    @other_cards = base.cards 
  end

  def display
    puts "#{name} is part of the #{faction} faction, with a power of #{power.to_s}"
  end 
end`
</code></pre>

<p>But once again, I&rsquo;ve gotten ahead of myself. The code above is a representation of a type of card found in the shufflebuilding game called, Smash Up™. The premise of the game is very simple, you take two decks of 20 cards of different factions (such as zombies, ninjas, etc.), and you smash them together to create one 40-card deck. These decks contain minion and action cards that are meant to be placed on other cards that represent bases. An example of the base below for example&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/ruby-classes/smashupbase.jpg" alt="Smash Up Base" /> All right reserved to AEG © 2016</p>

<p>&hellip;indicates that after the collective power of all minions there reaches 24, the base breaks and people are awarded the bigger numbers, or in this case everyone is awarded one victory point for every minion on there.</p>

<p>And the possible minion cards in question look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/ruby-classes/saucywench.jpg" alt="Saucy Wench" /> All right reserved to AEG © 2016</p>

<p>Some things to note, is that not every card has the same play ability, but for the sake of our example let&rsquo;s say they do, and each card can be created with a different faction, name, and power. Once a class has been created, it is said that instances of that class can be created containing the attributes supplied and with the ability to respond to the methods inside it (in our case the play method). Following this example then our Saucy Wench would be initialized as follows:</p>

<p><code>saucy_wench = MinionCard.new("Pirates", "Saucy Wench", 3) =&gt; [the code produced simply tells you the object has been created]</code></p>

<p>So how is this class doing its job, and how is the card being created? Let&rsquo;s break it down a bit. The first line of the code tells us that we&rsquo;re going to define a new class called MinionCard and contained in it will be unique attributes that can be defined at the object&rsquo;s creation time (these are called instance variables), as well the class will define some methods that the card will be able to respond to whenever we decide (these are called instance methods).</p>

<p>The second line contains any instance variables that we would like to be able to read outside of the class, I&rsquo;ll explain what this means a little later. For now, moving to the next piece of code, we have one method that is very common with classes, and that is the initialize method. This method is unique because it can be included with every class in order to dictate what exactly will happen when the object is initialized or first created. It will accept arguments, if you require them for object creation, (in our example we require a faction name, name of the card, and a power number) and then it turns them into instance variables.</p>

<h3>A little more on Instance Variables&hellip;</h3>

<p>The use of instance variables, these are easily recognizable by their starting &ldquo;@&rdquo; symbol, is very important when it comes to classes. They are very similar to local variables with a bit of a larger scope. While local variables can only be used in the area they&rsquo;re defined in&ndash;outside of methods, inside a particular method, etc., instance variable can be used anywhere inside the classes, including inside and outside the methods defined in that class.</p>

<pre><code>class SimpleClass 
  @instance_variable = "now you see me" 

  def instance_method 
    @instance_variable = "now you don't" 
  end 

  @instance_variable = "fin" 
end`
</code></pre>

<p>In the example above the <code>@instance_variable</code> is easily accessible throughout the class, including the instance_method in there that later redefines the variable.</p>

<h3>&hellip;but back to the class</h3>

<p>After the initialize method we have other methods that can be called on our Saucy Wench once created. There are some advanced concepts in those methods, but nonetheless contain some very key concepts. First, a few assumptions&ndash;let&rsquo;s assume that we have another class called <code>BaseCard</code> that we then use to create a base called &ldquo;Rhodes Plaza Mall&rdquo;. The purpose of this class, and the instance of it created thereafter, is to contain the information for the base card shown at the beginning of this post. Let&rsquo;s also assume that this class has an instance variable that allows it to store any cards &ldquo;played&rdquo; on it by adding it into an array (remember those?). The play method then can be called with an argument being the base card&hellip;</p>

<p><code>saucy_wench.play(rhodes_plaza_mall) =&gt; #</code></p>

<p>&hellip;it will then proceed to check if there are any other cards on that base by first running the <code>check_other_cards</code> method. The <code>check_other_cards</code> method will pass along the same argument variable (the base card name) and run it through what appears to be a <code>cards</code> method, but can actually also be an instance variable inside the BaseCard class that happens to be readable or writeable, or both (<code>attr_reader</code>, <code>attr_writer</code>, or <code>attr_accessor</code> respectively). We know that this will be the array that contains all the cards already &ldquo;played&rdquo; on that base, and it is placed inside another instance variable for the purpose of being passed around the class. Going back to the <code>play</code> method then, it gets a hold of the <code>base.cards</code> array as the newly acquired <code>@other_cards</code> instance variable, and then proceeds to iterate through those, deleting any cards of power 2 or less (I know, I know, the card says destroy just one, but for the sake of brevity&hellip;). Finally, the card then adds itself (<code>self</code>) to the roster of cards in the base.</p>

<p>The final method created in the MinionCard class, is the <code>display</code>, when called on the <code>saucy_wench</code> card it will print out a nicely formatted message with the details of the card.</p>

<p>With that I wrap up my explanation of classes, and I urge you to do some more research on them if they interest you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>enumerable methods: inject</h2>

<h3>&hellip;or the physics of a clown car</h3>

<p><img src="../imgs/enumerable/krustyklowncar.jpg" alt="Krusty Klown Car" /></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve all seen that archetypal clown car scene in the movies or tv shows&ndash;the one where an impossible amount of clowns get out or into a small car. It actually reminds me of a very neat method for objects in the Ruby language known as <em>enumerables</em>. But perhaps I&rsquo;m getting a little ahead of myself. Let me take you back to the beginning, to the root of the language, the core of programming, the genesis of objects&hellip; ok&hellip; you get it.</p>

<p>In a previous <a href="array-hashes.html">post</a>, I covered a topic on arrays and hashes. Remember those? If not, they look a little like this:</p>

<pre><code>clowns_array = ["noodles", "seesaw", "oopsie", 
                   "lopsweat", "hoohah", "jitters", 
                   "sir wide bottom"]
=&gt; ["noodles", "seesaw", "oopsie", "lopsweat", "hoohah", "jitters", "sir 
wide bottom"]

clown_car_hash = { clown_1: "noodles", 
                   clown_2: "seesaw", 
                   clown_3: "oopsie", 
                   clown_4: "lopsweat", 
                   clown_5: "hoohah", 
                   clown_6: "jitters", 
                   clown_7: "sir wide bottom" }
=&gt; {clown_1: "noodles", clown_2: "seesaw", clown_3: "oopsie", clown_4: 
"lopsweat", clown_5: "hoohah", clown_6: "jitters", clown_7: "sir 
wide bottom"}
</code></pre>

<p>Everything in Ruby is considered an object, and every object in part has a class, but it all ultimately ends up being an object. So why have that class-object distinction? Well classes simply help organize the attributes and behaviors of an object so they become predictable. Just like objects in the real world, objects in Ruby can be described by how and what they respond to. For example, had you a shadowy, fuzzy figure in front of you, and you happen to call its bark behavior (or method as it is known in Ruby), and it responds, &ldquo;woof!&rdquo;, then you know you might be dealing with an object of the Dog class. These methods aren&rsquo;t only useful for determining what you&rsquo;re dealing with, they can also alter, mold, or expand the use of the object.</p>

<p>Following this train of thought, then, we can start doing more with arrays and hashes, container objects, that are part of the Enumerable class. What this means is that, arrays and hashes contain elements that can be enumerated, or counted on one by one. It&rsquo;s by this enumerable trait, that most methods related to arrays and hashes allow you to read (<code>array.first</code> for example, diplays the first element) or control the contents, or elements, inside them. And there are a number of them, but the one that I will focus on, is the inject method.</p>

<pre><code>clowns_array.inject(Hash.new(0)) do |car, clown|
  p "#{car[(clowns_array.index(clown)+1)] = clown} &lt;&lt; #{clown}"
  car
end
"noodles &lt;&lt; noodles"
"seesaw &lt;&lt; seesaw"
"oopsie &lt;&lt; oopsie"
"lopsweat &lt;&lt; lopsweat"
"hoohah &lt;&lt; hoohah"
"jitters &lt;&lt; jitters"
"sir wide bottom &lt;&lt; sir wide bottom"
=&gt; {1=&gt;"noodles", 2=&gt;"seesaw", 3=&gt;"oopsie", 4=&gt;"lopsweat", 5=&gt;"hoohah", 6=&gt;"jitters", 7=&gt;"sir wide bottom"}
</code></pre>

<p>Right now don&rsquo;t worry if you don&rsquo;t understand the code up there. It&rsquo;s not normally how you would use the method, and I did it that way to expose the inner workings of the method. I will break it down slowly. On the surface, the inject method can be a very simple method to condense (or reduce) the contents of an array. Mathematically, this means you can take an array of numbers and squish them together to get their sum, or squish them with multiplication and get the factorial.</p>

<pre><code>mathary = (1..5).to_a
=&gt; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

mathary.inject(:*)
=&gt; 120
</code></pre>

<p>The code above creates a math array with the number one through five, and using the inject method with the multiplication symbol, reduces the numbers to a single number&ndash;the result of multiplying all those numbers together. But using the method this way makes the inject method appear to be a misnomer, why is it called inject? Ah, therein lies our clown car example&hellip;</p>

<h3>The Anatomy of Enumerable#inject</h3>

<p><img src="../imgs/enumerable/Inject_method.jpg" alt="Inject Method" /></p>

<p>Taking the method and expanding it to its most complicated use case, we can see that the method is called on an array, it takes an argument in parenthesis, which sets the initial value (anything from a number to another new array, or new hash&ndash;coincidentally this is the type of object that will be returned if no other is specified), finally a block is passed with further instructions. Some notable things about the block: the initial value is set as one of the variables (in our case the car), and the iteration of each element is set to the second variable (clown), this means that the code will execute every time using each clown once. This code indicates that the clown should be <em>injected</em> into the clown car by making the clown index in the array (one is added because array indices start with 0) the hash key, and the clown name becomes the value (again review the previous post to understand this). Finally, the car is returned to become the car variable again, and the next clown is <em>injected</em>, if the last line is omitted, then the last clown used becomes the new car variable and the next clown is then attempted to be <em>injected</em>. As you can see, that doesn&rsquo;t make sense in this context, a clown being injected into another clown&ndash;hilarious as that actually sounds, but it is the reason why using <em>inject</em> mathematically, works. Essentially, you&rsquo;re injecting each value back on the result of the operations performed on the previous values.</p>

<p>But now back to our clown car example, a diagram might help visualize what is going on. If the initial value, the clown car, is the hash (the two curly braces), and the clowns available is the array, then the code process looks like this:</p>

<p>And with that, I urge you to imagine these clowns hilariously jumping into a small car with seemingly limited space.

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>&hellip;or finding your Tupperware® lids</h3>

<p><img src="../imgs/array/containers.jpg" alt="Containers" /></p>

<p>No one can deny the usefulness of plastic containers&ndash;they&rsquo;re light, they&rsquo;re cheap, and they can hold anything from your loose cereal to your boardgame small bits and pieces. These <em>container objects</em> have made themselves indispensible, and it&rsquo;s no wonder that they have transferred over into the world of programming language. In Ruby, specifically, container objects come in the form of arrays and hashes.</p>

<h3>Arrays</h3>

<pre><code>computer_container = ["laptop", "mouse", "charger"]
=&gt; ["computer", "mouse", "charger"]
</code></pre>

<p>That up there is an example of a very basic array. In Ruby, an array is a list of things, each item separated by a comma and contained between two square brackets. The great thing about this type of container is that all the items remain ordered in their original position and so by default each item is automatically indexed into their position. You&rsquo;ll see what I mean when I break this down:</p>

<p><img src="../imgs/array/Arrays.jpg" alt="Arrays" /></p>

<p>As the image above shows, once I place these items into the container, they remain in that indexed positioned, so the laptop is now at index &ldquo;0&rdquo;, the mouse is at index &ldquo;1&rdquo;, and so on and so forth. This is useful when you need to iterate (or go over the list item by item) by index, or if you want to recall the item by its index as follows:</p>

<pre><code>computer_container[1]
=&gt; "mouse"
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, because of the nature of the array, it&rsquo;s very easy to manipulate their content to be sorted and rearranged. And again, this nature lends itself well for mathematical uses. An array can be created with numbers and then mathemactical operations can be applied internally.</p>

<pre><code>mathary = (1..5).to_a
=&gt; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

mathary.map { |x| x * 2 }
=&gt; [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
</code></pre>

<p>In the example above, an array containing the numbers one through five was created, then using the map method, it applied the code within the curly braces. In this case, taking each number and multiplying it by two, producing the new array.</p>

<p>So as you can see, arrays are greatly useful for containing an ordered list of things, to-do list item, a list of your favorite numbers, anything! Now, when it comes to providing your own labels to your items, well, we need Array&rsquo;s bigger, more nosy cousin, the Hash.</p>

<h3>Hash</h3>

<pre><code>shiny_hash = { "Edgar"  =&gt; 25, 
               "Oscar"  =&gt; 29, 
               "Booper" =&gt; 24 }
</code></pre>

<p>A hash is very similar to an array, except for its ability to contain labeled items. Or in other words, a value that is attached to a unique key. In the example above, &ldquo;Edgar&rdquo;, &ldquo;Oscar&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Booper&rdquo; are all keys pointing to a value of 25, 29, and 24, respectively. In other languages, hashes are also called dictionaries, and it&rsquo;s not hard to see why. Once created and filled with the information you like, values inside the hash can be recalled using its key. Almost like looking up a definition by the word.</p>

<blockquote><p><pre   `
    fancy_dictionary = { "totes"  => &ldquo;Colloquial term
                                      for totally&rdquo;,
                         &ldquo;LOL&rdquo;    => &ldquo;Short for laugh out
                                      loud&rdquo;,
                         &ldquo;fleek&rdquo;  => &ldquo;Above acceptable in
                                      quality&rdquo; }`
    </pre></p></blockquote>

<p>If we were to create a dictionary hash like the one above, then searching for a definition would be a matter of addressing its key pair, like this:</p>

<pre><code>fancy_dictionary['fleek']
=&gt; "Above acceptable in quality"
</code></pre>

<p>Now, hashes can be just as useful as arrays for containing lots of information, but their unique use comes from methods that allow you to verify or compare keys and values against let&rsquo;s say a variable or even user input. One such example is the creation of email and password hashes that can be used as a way to log in to a website.</p>

<p>Keep in mind this is just a taste of what arrays and hashes can do, if you&rsquo;re interested in finding out more, the Ruby docs contains very detailed information on what you can do with arrays and hashes. <a href="http://http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html">Ruby Array</a> and <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Hash.html">Ruby Hash</a>.</p>
