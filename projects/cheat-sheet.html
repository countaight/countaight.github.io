				<h2>for <span class="word_loop">loop</span></h2>
				<p>
					For loops in JavaScript are a bit more involved, but still straight forward. The condition for the loops includes a variable counter assigment, a condition for the variable to assess, and an increment value.
				</p>
				<div class="example-body">
				<pre>
for (var i = 0; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log("Variable i is", i);
}
Variable i is 0.
Variable i is 1.
Variable i is 2.
Variable i is 3.
Variable i is 4.
Variable i is 5.
=> undefined</pre>
				</div>

			<section class="examples">
				<h2>for...in <span class="word_loop">loop</span></h2>
				<p>
					Similar to Ruby's for...in loop; they take a variable which applies an index to each element of an array or object. The variable must also be passed to the array or object in order to access the value.
				</p>
				<div class="example-body">
				<pre>
var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for (var i in array) {
  console.log("Index", i, "has a value of", array[i] + ".");
}
Index has 0 a value of 1.
Index has 1 a value of 2.
Index has 2 a value of 3.
Index has 3 a value of 4.
Index has 4 a value of 5.
=> undefined</pre>

				<h2>while <span class="word_loop">loop</span></h2>
				<p>
					While loops in JavaScript execute the code as long as the condition remains true. It's a smart idea to be able to make the condition false, or else you will run into an infinite <span class="word_loop">loop</span>.
				</p>
				<div class="example-body">
				<pre>
var i = 1
while (i < 5) {
  console.log("This has run", i, "time(s).");
  i++;

This has run 5 time(s).
