* What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
* What did you learn about CSS positioning?
* What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
* What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I learned that padding, borders, and margins really help the layout of a site by creating the needed spacing after placement is done. Borders help delineate content, padding helps position inner content, and margins help create spacings in between elements.

CSS positioning can get out of hand really quickly. It's best to start with a simple flow and apply position from top to bottom in order to gauge the different effects. Floating helps place content side by side, while position properties help position elements more carefully.

The header, main, and side elements were very easy to implement. Floating the elements and position help direct them in the right place. The most difficult was implementing the navigation bar, menu items, and side bar menu items. List items can be tricky to manipulate. As soon as a position or formatting was added, it would change the margin or padding.

Again it's better to work from a broad perpective and then hone in on the details. CSS helps with this because you can apply a general style to the major parts and then go in using classes or more specific selectros to really apply the exact styling you'd like. For this reason, it's also important to have visualization of the hierchy of elements.
