# About Me

I'm a native-born Mexican raised in Chicago, who loves learning from people and their experiences.
Skills

From most experience to least, I am an advanced paper-folder. That's right, I've been doing Origami, the Japanese art of paper folding, since the sixth grade. After a fellow classmate denied me the opportunity to learn how to fold a particular model, I took it upon myself to learn. I've been also been doing professional photography for about 6 years, it had always been a passion of mine but I couldn't afford a camera until a couple of years after getting my first job. Around the same time I also found and started training in the Brazilian martial art of Capoeira. Musically, I love to sing, although I haven't had any formal training, and I'm a novice piano player, having practiced on and off for a couple of years.

##Work

I'm currently employed in a freight fowarding/carrier trucking company owned by my family. I am also currently enrolled in DevBootcamp with hopes of becoming a full stack developer.
